description: Basic Hello World Kafka Streams Application
---

This blog post will quickly get you off the ground and show you how Kafka Streams works. We’re going to make a toy application that takes incoming messages and upper-cases the text of those messages, effectively yelling at anyone who reads the message. This application is called the "Yelling Application".

<!--more-->

Before diving into the code let’s take a look at the processing topology
you’ll assemble for this “yelling” application. We’ll build a processing
graph topology, where each node in the graph has a particular function.

NOTE: (Save 37% off [*Kafka Streams in Action*](https://www.manning.com/books/kafka-streams-in-action) with code **streamkafka**)

As you can see from the image, we’re building a simple processing graph.
It’s simple enough to resemble a linked list of nodes more than the
typical tree-like structure of a graph. But there’s enough here to give
us strong clues as to what expect in the code. It requires a source
node, a processor node that transforms incoming text to uppercase, and
finally, a processor that writes results out to a topic. I’m going to
show the whole application first; then I’ll walk through and explain
each piece.

```java Listing 1 Hello World – The Yelling Application

 public class KafkaStreamsYellingApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

     Properties props = new Properties();
     props.put(StreamsConfig.APPLICATION_ID_CONFIG, "yelling_app_id");
     props.put(StreamsConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");

     StreamsConfig streamingConfig = new StreamsConfig(props);

     Serde<String> stringSerde = Serdes.String();

     KStreamBuilder kStreamBuilder = new KStreamBuilder();
     Stream<String,String> simpleFirstStream =kStreamBuilder.stream( stringSerde, stringSerde, "src-topic");

     KStream<String, String> upperStream = simpleFirstStream.mapValues(String::toUpperCase); 
     upperStream.to(stringSerde, stringSerde, "out-topic");
     KafkaStreams kafkaStreams = new KafkaStreams(kStreamBuilder,streamingConfig);
     kafkaStreams.start();
    }
}
```

Here are the main points of the program above 

 1.  Properties for configuring the Kafka Streams program (line 5).
 2.  Creating the StreamsConfig with the given properties (line 8).
 3.  Creating the Serdes used to serialize/deserialize keys and
    values (line 10).
 4.   Creating the KStreamBuilder instance used to construct our
    processor topology (12).
 5. Creating the stream with a source topic to read from (Parent node
    in the graph) (line 13).
 6.  A processor using a Java 8 method handle (first child node in the
    graph) (line 15).
 7.  Writing the transformed output to another topic (last/terminal
    node in the graph) (line 16).
 8. Kicking off the Kafka Stream thread(s) (line 18).

This is a trivial example, but the code shown here is representative of
what you’ll see in Kafka Streams programs. We will refer to this initial program points listed here throughout the blog.

With more advanced examples, the principal difference is the complexity
of processor topology. With that in mind let’s take a walk through our
first code sample presented here.

***Configuration***

Although Kafka Streams is highly configurable, with several properties
you can adjust for your specific needs; our first example uses two
configuration settings. Both of these are required because there are no
default values provided. Attempting to start a Kafka Streams program
without these two properties defined results in throwing a
ConfigException.

```java Listing 2 Setting Configuration Items
   props.put(StreamsConfig.APPLICATION_ID_CONFIG, "yelling_app_id");
   props.put(StreamsConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");
```


-   StreamsConfig.APPLICATION_ID_CONFIG: This property identifies your
    Kafka Streams application and must be a unique value for the entire
    cluster. The application id config also serves as a default value
    for the client-id prefix and group-id parameters if you don’t set
    either value. The client-id prefix is the user-defined value used to
    identify clients connecting to Kafka uniquely. The group-id is used
    to manage the membership of a group of consumers all reading from
    the same topic and assures that many consumers can effectively read
    subscribed topics in the group.

-   StreamsConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG: The bootstrap servers
    configuration can be a single hostname:port setting or multiple
    values comma separated. The value of this setting should be apparent
    as it points the Kafka Streams application to the Kafka cluster.

***Serde Creation***

```java Listing 3 Instantiating a String Serde
    Serde<String> stringSerde = Serdes.String();
```

This line (from point number 3 of listing 1) is where you create the
Serde instance required for serialization/deserialization of the
key/value pair of every message, and store it in a variable for use
later on. The Serde class provides default implementations for the
following types:

-   Strings

-   Byte arrays

-   Long

-   Integer

-   Double

The `Serde` class is extremely useful as it’s used to contain the
serializer and deserializer, which eliminates the repetition for having
to specify four parameters (key serializer, value serializer, key
deserializer and value deserializer) every time you need to provide a
serde in a KStream method. In our next example, we’ll show how to create
your implementation to handle serialization/deserialization Serde of
more complex types.

***Creating the Topology***

Now let’s turn our attention to points 5, 6, and 7 from listing 1. It’s
in these three sections of the code that we build up the processing
topology or graph. We’ll present the graph with the relevant point
highlighted to make it easier to follow how the code relates to the
processing topology.

Figure 2 Creating the Source Node of the 'Yelling' App
<img src="{{ site.media_url }}/images/ks/figure_2.jpg"/>


```java Listing 4 Defining the Source for the Stream
   KStream<String,String> simpleFirstStream = kStreamBuilder.stream(stringSerde, stringSerde, "src-topic");
```

With this line of code (from point number 5), you’re creating the source
or parent node of the graph. The source node of a topology consumes
records from a given topic or topics.

In this case, it’s aptly named "src-topic" and the KStream instance
`simpleFirstStream` starts consuming messages written to this
topic.

Figure 3 Adding the UpperCase Processor to the 'Yelling' App
<img src="{{ site.media_url }}/images/ks/figure_3.jpg"/>


```java Listing 5 Mapping Incoming Text to Uppercase
   KStream<String, String> upperStream = simpleFirstStream.mapValues(String::toUpperCase);
```


With this line (point number 6) you’re creating another KStream instance
that’s a child node of the parent node. By calling the `KStream.mapValues`
function you’re creating a new processing node whose inputs are the
results of going through the mapValues call. It’s important to remember
that `mapValues` doesn’t modify the original values. 

The upperStream instance receives transformed copies of the initial value from the `simpleFirstStream.mapValues` call. In this case, it’s upper-case text.
The mapValues method takes an instance of the `ValueMapper<V, V1>`
interface. 

The interface defines only one method `ValueMapper.apply`, making it an ideal candidate for using a Java 8
lambda expression. We’ve done this with `String::toUpperCase`, which is a
method reference – an even shorter form of a Java 8 lambda expression.

NOTE:
Although many Java 8 tutorials are available for lambda expressions and
method references, good starting points are
[lamda expressions](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html) and
[method references](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/methodreferences.html)
respectively.

You could’ve used the form of `(s) -> s.toUpperCase()`, but because `toUpperCase`
is an instance method on the `String` class, we can use a method
reference. Using lambda expressions versus concrete implementations is a
pattern we’ll see over and over with the KStreams API. Most of the
methods expect types that are single method interfaces, and you can
easily use Java 8 lambdas.

Figure 4 Adding Processor for Writing 'Yelling' App Results

```java Listing 6 Creating a Sink Node
   upperStream.to(stringSerde, stringSerde, "out-topic");
```

Here (point 7) we add the last processor in the graph. By calling the
method, you’re creating a terminal node in the topology – `Kstream.to` to
be more precise. You’re creating a sink node where the upperStream
processor writes the key-value pairs to a topic named "out-topic".

Any KStream method that has a return type of void is a terminal node and it
ends stream processing at that point, but it may not necessarily be a
sink node. Again we see the pattern of providing the required serde
instances needed for serialization/deserialization when reading from or
writing to a Kafka topic.

NOTE:
One note about serde usage in Kafka Streams. Several overloaded methods
are in the KStream API where you don’t need to specify the key/value
serdes. In those cases, the application uses the serializer/deserializer
specified in the configuration instead.

In our example above we used three lines (steps 5, 6, and 7 from listing
1) to build the topology.

```java Listing 7 Building Processor Topology in Stages
   KStream<String,String> simpleFirstStream = kStreamBuilder.stream(stringSerde, stringSerde, "src-topic");
   KStream<String, String> upperStream = simpleFirstStream.mapValues(String::toUpperCase);
   upperStream.to(stringSerde, stringSerde, "out-topic");
```


Having each step on an individual line was used to demonstrate each
stage of the building process clearly. All methods in the KStream API
that don’t create terminal nodes return a new KStream instance.
Returning a KStream object allows for using the "fluent interface" style
of programming. To demonstrate this idea, here’s another way you could
have constructed the yelling application topology:

```java Listing 8 Building Processor Topology Using Fluent Style
   kStreamBuilder.stream(stringSerde,stringSerde,"src-topic").mapValues(String::toUpperCase).to(stringSerde,stringSerde,"out-topic");
```

We shortened our program from three lines to one without losing any
clarity or purpose.

Congratulations, you’ve constructed a Kafka Streams application! Let’s
quickly review the steps taken, as it’s a general pattern seen in most
Kafka Streams applications. Specifically, you took the following steps:

-   Created a StreamsConfig instance.

-   Then you created a Serde object.

-   You constructed a processing topology.

-   After putting all the pieces into place, you started the Kafka
    Streams program.

Aside from the general construction of a Kafka Streams application, a
key takeaway here is to use lambda expressions whenever possible to make
your programs more concise.
