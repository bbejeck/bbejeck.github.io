I have read over and over the past year that starting a blog is one of the best ways to improve your value as a software developer.  Also, a great way to learn something is to write about it.  So with that in mind, I have started this blog.  I am going to cover varied topics in software development and I hope that I can help someone else learn as well as myself.
