description: Lessons I learned while writing a book that I'd like to share
---

Earlier this year I completed the 2nd edition of [Kafka Streams in Action](https://www.amazon.com/Kafka-Streams-Action-Second-Bejeck/dp/1617298689/). Even though it's a second edtion, there were several things I wanted to change from the first edition, so it ended up being mostly a complete re-write.  Writing a book is a large undertaking, and while it's probably the most challenging task I've ever undertaken, it was extremely rewarding and I don't regret the amount of time I spent working
