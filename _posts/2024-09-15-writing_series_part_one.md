description: Lessons I learned while writing a book that I'd like to share
---

Earlier this year I completed the 2nd edition of [Kafka Streams in Action](https://www.amazon.com/Kafka-Streams-Action-Second-Bejeck/dp/1617298689/). Even though it's a second edtion, there were several things I wanted to change from the first edition, so it ended up being mostly a complete re-write.  Writing a book is a large undertaking, and while it's probably the most challenging task I've ever undertaken, it was extremely rewarding and I don't regret the amount of time I spent working on it.  I learned several lessons along the way that I'd like to share in the hopes that someone else will benefit from my experience (if anything, writing about it will help solidify the information for myself).   I have four main points I'd like to cover:
 - Yes Virigina, you need to have a plan
 - Have a good yardstick
 - No matter what, never block
 - The magic of 100 words
