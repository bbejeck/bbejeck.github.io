description: Lessons I learned while writing a book that I'd like to share
---

Earlier this year I completed the 2nd edition of [Kafka Streams in Action](https://www.amazon.com/Kafka-Streams-Action-Second-Bejeck/dp/1617298689/). Even though it's a second edtion, there were several things I wanted to change from the first edition, so it ended up being mostly a complete re-write.  Writing a book is a large undertaking, and while it's probably the most challenging task I've ever undertaken, it was extremely rewarding and I don't regret the amount of time I spent working on it.  I learned several lessons along the way that I'd like to share in the hopes that someone else will benefit from my experience (if anything, writing about it will help solidify the information for myself).   I have several points I'd like to discuss: 

  - Yes Virigina, you need a schedule plan
  - Have a good yardstick
  - The magic of 100 words 
  - Objects in the mirror are smaller than they appear
  - No matter what, never block
 
This list is a lot to cover in one post so I'll break this up over two posts.

# Yes Virgina, you must have a plan
 
The need for planning was probably my biggest surprise during the process.  While the need for planning might seem obvious to some, to me it was a revelation.  I held the mistaken belief that I would simply sit down with the intent to write, the inspiriation would start flowing and my fingers would begin to furiously pound on the keyboard.  

Additionally, I was sure that my productivity was a linear process, the more time I had, the more I'd get written.  I quickly found those beliefs couldn't be further from the truth.  What my actual experience looked like was sitting down, distracted and not having an idea what I wanted to say.  I'd get a few words down, my mind would drift and then inevitably I'm surfing on the internet looking at things that couldn't be further from what I'm writing about ("What happended to the cast of [Gilligan's Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilligan%27s_Island)?)"   It seemed the more time I had, the *__less__* I accomplished.

This large block of time/low productivity scenario could be attributed to an issue known as Parkinson's Law:

> Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion

[^1]:[Parkinson, Cyril Northcote (19 November 1955). "Parkinson's Law". The Economist. London.](https://www.economist.com/news/1955/11/19/parkinsons-law)

In other words, if you allow yourself a large block of time without specific plans or goals, there's a high chance you'll use the entire time and achieve very little.  

So what's the solution to this less than ideal working situation?  Planning and setting a schedule with deadlines.  While many of us [resist setting deadlines, the bottom line is they work](https://theengineeringmanager.substack.com/p/parkinsons-law-its-real-so-use-it).  Consider the following illustration

  <figcaption>Schedule defined blocks of time for a specific tasks vs. large blocks with no goal</figcaption>
</figure>

The main idea is that instead of a big block of time to get something done, you need to set _smaller_ amounts of time with a specific outcome defined. The size of the work blocks and break time shown here is arbitrary, but I would recommend blocks of [60-90 minutes](https://www.supernormal.com/blog/how-to-schedule-focus-time#:~:text=How%20long%20should%20focus%20sessions,to%20deliver%20the%20best%20results.).  It's also important to allow for some time in the beginning to get into the "flow", it's nearly impossible to sit down to write and be productive immediately. A good resource for establishing a work-break process is the [Pomodoro&reg; technique](https://www.pomodorotechnique.com/) 

# Have a good yardstick

Along with have a good schedule, I found having concrete markers to measure my progress invaluable.  Being able to guage your progress goes hand-in-hand with establishing a good schedule.  For me it was counting the number words (exlusive of code examples) written.  For [Kafka Streams in Action](https://www.amazon.com/Kafka-Streams-Action-Second-Bejeck/dp/1617298689/), the publisher guidlines set each chapter to be roughly 30 pagess.  At 30 pages, I'd have about 9,000 words.  My goal was to produce a new chapter every 3 weeks.  To achive that pace I determined that I'd need to write 500 words a day, 6 days a week (one day off is essential in my opinion). At that pace I'd produce 3,000 words a week, resulting in a new chapter every 3 weeks.  While my progress was not always on a linear path, it allowed my to accurately asses my productivity.  More importantly it would help me adjust my schedule when the inevitable life interruptions came along.  Not able to write 2 days this week? Not a big deal just up my word count on two other days to 1,000 or to 750 words per day for four days and I'd still be on track.
