description: Lessons I learned while writing a book that I'd like to share
---

Earlier this year I completed the 2nd edition of [Kafka Streams in Action](https://www.amazon.com/Kafka-Streams-Action-Second-Bejeck/dp/1617298689/). Even though it's a second edtion, there were several things I wanted to change from the first edition, so it ended up being mostly a complete re-write.  Writing a book is a large undertaking, and while it's probably the most challenging task I've ever undertaken, it was extremely rewarding and I don't regret the amount of time I spent working on it.  I learned several lessons along the way that I'd like to share in the hopes that someone else will benefit from my experience (if anything, writing about it will help solidify the information for myself).   I have several points I'd like to discuss: 

  - Yes Virigina, you need to plan
  - Have a good yardstick
  - The magic of 100 words 
  - Objects in the mirror are smaller than they appear
  - No matter what, never block
 
This list is a lot to cover in one post so I'll break this up over two posts.

I held the mistaken belief that I would simply sit down, the inspiriation would start flowing and my fingers would begin to furiously pound on the keyboard.  Additionally, I was sure that my productivity was a linear process, the more time I had, the more I'd get written.  I quickly found those beliefs couldn't be further from the truth.  What my actual experience looked like was sitting down, distracted and not having an idea what I wanted to say.  I'd get a few words down, my mind would drift and then inevitably I'm surfing on the internet looking at things that couldn't be further from what I'm writing about ("What happended to the cast of [Gilligan's Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilligan%27s_Island)?"  As for the time alotted, it seemed the more time I dedicated to writing the *__less__* I would get done.

So what's the solution to this less than ideal working situation?  Planning.  Instead of just sitting down with an unlimted time-budget, you must pick a time you'll start *__and__* how long you'll write.  That second part of specifying *_how long_*you'll
