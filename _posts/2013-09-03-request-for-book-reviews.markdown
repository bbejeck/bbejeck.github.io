<img class="left" src="{{ site.media_url }}/images/guavaBookImage.png" /> **Note: I've been informed by the publisher, Packt, that we have enough reviewers as of now, so I am no longer accepting any more.  Thanks to those that have signed up**Greetings all! This is not my typical post, but I have a good reason. I've recently written and published my first book [Getting Started with Google Guava](http://www.packtpub.com/getting-started-with-google-guava/book) and I am currently looking for Java developers to review the book. It doesn't matter if have worked with Guava before or not. There is no compensation involved, but you will get a free copy of the book in exchange for your review.  If you are interested, just fill out and submit the form below and I'll get you in touch with the publisher. Thanks for indulging me in this shameless self-promotional post, and our regular scheduled content will resume soon.
